    <h1>Intrepid Texan's Life Stories</h1>
    <p>
I've been blessed to have led a very dynamic, exciting and adventurous life. My professional career was in aerospace operations but I'm now retired to handyman work, travel, and hobbies.  I served as a USAF fighter pilot, senior wartime commander in Afghanistan, a NASA systems engineer (think Mission Control Center - I was on duty there when the Challenger accident occurred), and led large teams running facilities in Europe and Antarctica.  Many of my stories have tragic elements which have shaped my perspectives on life, relationships and the fleeting nature of our time on earth.  I was surrounded by death or the imminent threat of death my entire career.  In retirement my enduring life desire is to be kind to All, even if doing so upsets Some (that's their issue), and to leave things better than I found them. I have learned to accept that others may always question my motives and choose to view situations through their own pain-based filters.  Such is our human condition.
