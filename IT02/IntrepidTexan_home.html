    <h1>Intrepid Texan</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal website; a work in progress with the help of ChatGPT!</p>
    <p>Below are links to three of my favorite hobbies: travel, long distance hiking and storytelling.</p>
    <p>Intrepid is my trail name and I was born and raised in Texas, hence the website name. I’ve hiked 1800+ miles in the past few years, mostly along the various Camino Santiago trails in France, Portugal and Spain but also segments of the Pacific Crest and Appalachian Trails. I prefer the Camino because there is an infrastructure of hostels and restaurants that reduce the pack from 60# to around 20# or less.  I've even hiked a short portion of the Great Wall of China and several short trails in Antarctica. </p>
    <p>The website contains information that you may find of value when planning your early Camino adventures. Once you’ve hiked a trail or two you’ll develop your own “system” but until then perhaps my experiences will help you along “The Way”.</p>
